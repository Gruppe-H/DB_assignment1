The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.



The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990â2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 



The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 



The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.', 10, 10);

The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.



Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.



Baltimore Cityâs Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimoreâs Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.



Compiling Baltimore Cityâs emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.



For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore Cityâs geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore Cityâs inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.', 40, 257);

The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Simplified generalizations of the equations used for emission calculations are used. These are based on the assumption that emissions of a given activity can be estimated using data descriptive for the size of the activity multiplied by an emission factor pr unit or activity. That is, the inventory is primarily based on scope-2 data on heat and power consumption and scope-1 data on road traffic.



The method includes CO2-, CH4- and N2O-emission in the inventory.



As for the national inventories the calculation is built into several levels (Tiers) with increased requirements for municipalities regarding data quality. Each municipality may use different tiers for different sectors depending on the data available.



Tier 1 is mainly based on the Danish national greenhouse gas inventory data using appropriate distribution keys, in most cases the municipality''s share of total population, for a given activity into municipality level.



Tier 2 is more detailed and includes emission factors used in the Danish national greenhouse gas inventories, while municipalities use their own activity data.



At Tier 3, which is the most detailed level; municipalities use municipality specific emission factors and activity data.', 103, 99);

Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.

For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 - other).

Another category that deserves observation refers to the disposal of solid waste in landfills. For this category we used the GPC, which allocates all expected emissions inventory in the year in which the waste is landfilled, IIS was not used for the calculation of this emission source.', 106, 102);
