This makes New York the largest city to commit to the 80 percent reduction by 2050, and charts a long-term path for investment in renewable sources of energy and a total transition from fossil fuels.



Nearly three quarters of New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used to heat, cool, and power buildings, making building retrofits a central component of any plan to dramatically reduce emissions.



The City is poised to make direct investments to increase the efficiency of its public buildings, including schools and public housing, reducing the government’s contribution to climate change and generating operational savings for New York City taxpayers. Every single city-owned building with any significant energy use – approximately 3,000 buildings – will be retrofitted within the next ten years, by 2025, with interim goals along the way.', '2016', '15', '93');

They are here today. The damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 provided vivid evidence of these risks. Almost two years later, we are still recovering. Globally, climate change is having a devastating impact on people’s lives as rising sea levels flood coastlines, droughts disrupt livelihoods, and storms, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events threaten security and economic development.



For this reason, New York City is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80 percent by 2050—the level the United Nations projects is needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change—and will chart a long-term course for a total transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.
