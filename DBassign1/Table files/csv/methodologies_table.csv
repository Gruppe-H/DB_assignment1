The following GHG protocols were used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory:

The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints.

The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. 

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. 

The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.",10,10

a. Energy Heating and Cooling:
The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure. Additionally, data is acquired from Toronto Hydro and Enbridge Gas on the electricity and natural gas consumption of the entire city, including residential, industrial, commercial, institutional etc...

Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: 
-truck traffic counts of over 2,000 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division
-accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2009 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division

39,U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ICLEI),"ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations.

Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures.

Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts.

Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records.

For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.",40,257

76,Other,"The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).

Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.

Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.

All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).",77,74

The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level.
