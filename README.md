### 1. Explore the data and formulate considerations about a hosting database.

We choose the first dataset named: 2016_-_Citywide_GHG_Emissions_20240207 aka. GHG_Emissions.csv
## It includes:

NOTES: 
We explored the 5 dataset files with pandas in JupyterNotebooks / Python. 
* After comparing the 5 datasets, we reduced it down two of the csv files. Because they have more data then the other three discarted ones (eks. GDP data)
* And then we choose the GHG_Emissions.csv becausw it has less "filler" data then the other dataset Communti_wide_Emissions.csv.

### 2. Design and develop proper database structure of the requested type.

### 3. Ingest the data into the database, include pre-processing of it, if necessary.

### 4. Design and develop operations for maintenance of the database.

### 5. Formulate ten relevant questions for extracting information from the database, design and develop database functionality for implementing the information extraction (for the relevance consult the instructor).

### 6. Design and implement a model for scaling the database, considering ACID and/or CAP theorem rules.

### 7. Validate and test all database operations.

### 8. Evaluate the databaseâ€™s performance and suggest measures for improving it.

### 9. Document your work, describing the product and the process. Apply graphical notation (diagrams), when it is possible.

### 10. Formulate conclusions and recommendations.
